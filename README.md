# Card List App

A React application that demonstrates:
- Virtualized list rendering using **react-window**  
- A **Scroll to Top** button with smooth scrolling  
- Component-level testing using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**

---

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone MY-APP
   cd my-app
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
4. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test

# Summary of Approach
The application is split into three main components:

-	Built reusable components: Card, CardList, and ScrollToTopButton.
-	Used react-window to optimize performance when rendering 1000+ cards.
-	Added a scroll-to-top button with custom visibility logic.
-	Centralized styles in style.css.
-	Configured Babel + Jest for React testing environment.

## Virtual Scrolling Implementation
- Implemented using react-windowâ€™s FixedSizeList.
- Instead of rendering all 1000+ cards in the DOM, only the visible items + a -    small buffer are rendered at a time.
- This ensures smooth performance and avoids unnecessary re-rendering.

# Testing
- Testing is done using Jest + React Testing Library.
- CSS imports are mocked using identity-obj-proxy in jest.config.js.

## Tests included:
**Card Rendering**
Ensures title & description are displayed correctly.

**ScrollToTop Buttn**
Ensures button only appears after 300px scroll.
Ensures click scrolls list back to top.

**Virtualized List Rendering**
Ensures that the first few visible cards (e.g., Card 1, Card 5) are rendered into the DOM.

Run tests:
```bush
npm test
